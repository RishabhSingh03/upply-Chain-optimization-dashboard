# upply-Chain-optimization-dashboard
In this advanced-level Tableau project, I created a comprehensive dashboard to optimize supply chain operations across procurement, production, and distribution stages. Using real-world supply chain data, I applied advanced data visualization techniques and integrate Python-based predictive models to identify bottlenecks, forecast demand, and manage inventory levels effectively. This hands-on experience will enhanced my skills in data analysis, predictive modeling, and dashboard creation, providing valuable insights for strategic supply chain management and decision-making.

Tools and Technologies:

Tableau Desktop
Python (for predictive modeling)
